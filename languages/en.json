        "mainFaqTextp-1":"Keep in mind that the mini Hellodolls and some of the big ones have delicate and small details (buttons, bows, bows), so they are only recommended for the soft play of children over three years old, or as decoration of a children's room. However, some of the larger dolls have bows or ribbons as accessories made of a size large enough that they cannot be inhaled or swallowed. It is unlikely, but under a lot of effort or pressure or after a lot of use these items could come off. However, it is always necessary to remember that play should always be done under adult supervision, and extreme vigilance should be exercised when children are very young.",

If nobody is home to sign for the package, you might have to make a phone call or trip to your local post office (USPS if you're in the U.S.A.).Your customs fees or import taxes are NOT included in the price of the item. Additional charges may be levied by your country based on individual import laws. I am not able to mark your package as a gift to avoid these fees- sorry to disappoint. I cannot be held responsible for packages getting lost or not delivered due to incorrectly entered addresses. If this occurs and packages return to me I will either issue a refund for the price of the item or re-ship it to the correct address at your expense.",

Then I studied architecture and worked 17 years in the construction industry, but I continued playing with fabrics and threads, making stuffs for my two lovely boys. After a year of deep work stress, in the midst of a  modern and accelarated professional life I realized that I needed to connect with my inner child and get back to enjoying and having fun like in childhood. And Hellodoll was born. In the beginning it was a therapy, a kind of space to meditate and release creativity, and almost without realizing it, I was dedicating the whole day to make cuddly toys and dolls.",
